				Greetings, traveler. Finally, the hour has come when %%
				I can give you a valuable gift. He was created %%
				specifically for you - for a hero, just starting out. %%
				And I very much hope that it will help you resist %%
				the dark side of this dangerous world Lineage 2. %%
				Accept my gift - a *bonus box*. Opening it, you %%
				get a * unique * equipment, depending on your %%
				profession. This gift you can use right now, and he %%
				will fill you with new strength. Hurry up, because %%
				my *gift* you can take at the very beginning of his %%
				career. %%
