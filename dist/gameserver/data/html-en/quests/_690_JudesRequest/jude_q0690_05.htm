!Jude:

Ah! By my count, you have collected less than *200* Evil Weapons. You can obtain more from the *Lesser Evils and Greater Evils in the Monster Foundry*. Do your best! If you collect *200 Evil Weapons*, I will exchange them for the S80 Grade weapon recipe. If you prefer, I can also exchange 5 Evil Weapons for 3 S80 Grade weapon pieces right now.

[Quest _690_JudesRequest reply_1|Collect more Evil Weapons.]
